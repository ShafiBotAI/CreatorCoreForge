# -ios-apps


This repository collects multiple experimental iOS projects that integrate AI-driven features. Each app lives under `apps/`.

- **CoreForge Visual** ‚Äì video and story creation suite. See `apps/CoreForgeVisual/README.md`.
- **CoreForge Audio** ‚Äì voice-controlled reader with offline vault. See `apps/CoreForgeAudio/README.md`.
- **CoreForge Leads** ‚Äì data analysis utilities. See `apps/CoreForgeLeads/README.md`.
- **CoreForge Music** ‚Äì beat and hook generation tools. See `apps/CoreForgeMusic/README.md`.
- **CoreForge Writer** ‚Äì book publishing assistant. See `apps/CoreForgeWriter/README.md`.
- **CoreForge Market** ‚Äì trading strategy companion. See `apps/CoreForgeMarket/README.md`.

Recent updates introduce advanced AI stubs across all apps to prepare for next-generation features.
The shared `VoiceMemoryManager` now supports exporting and importing assignments
so creators can sync character voice selections across apps. `FusionEngine`
exposes this manager along with a built-in `SceneGenerator` and hooks for
`AIStudioMode` and `GenesisModeEngine` so each app can reuse the same logic.

TestFlight workflows are provided under `.github/workflows` for continuous delivery.
Pushes to `main` automatically run `fastlane-testflight.yml` which builds **all** iOS
projects under `apps/` and uploads them to TestFlight
using the `build_all` lane. Configure `APPSTORECONNECT_*` secrets in your
repository so the workflow can authenticate with App Store Connect. You can also
manually trigger `upload-testflight.yml` from the Actions tab when a one-off
build is ready for distribution.

For production releases, trigger `upload-appstore.yml` which uses the
`build_all` lane to build every iOS project and submit the resulting
artifacts directly to App Store Connect.

See `docs/AI-Prompt-Migration.md` for integrating the new OpenAI prompt interface across apps.
See `docs/LocalOpenAIReplacement.md` for a primer on using the LocalAI engines to mimic OpenAI features without an internet connection.
See `docs/VoiceTrainerGuide.md` for using the local voice training engine.
See `docs/ModuleMigrationGuide.md` for adopting shared Phase 8 modules across apps.
All apps now include a `VideoShareManager` for posting generated videos directly to social media.

An accompanying `VideoEffectsPipeline` adds fade transitions, watermarking, and frame interpolation so every generated clip looks professional across apps.
An accompanying `VideoEffectsPipeline` adds fade transitions, fade-in/out effects, and watermarking so every generated clip looks professional across apps.

The new `AudioEffectsPipeline` provides echo and pitch-shift utilities so exported audio sounds consistent across apps.
The new `FusionEngine` wrapper automatically selects between `LocalAIEnginePro` and `OpenAIService` for each app, enabling offline-first development when `USE_LOCAL_AI` is set. It now supports contextual memory, parallel execution across multiple engines, emotion tracking, sandbox mode for isolated testing, cross-app voice memory, on-device summarization, and quick scene generation helpers.


## OpenAI Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide your `OPENAI_API_KEY` before running any app or tests. The shared `OpenAIService` reads this value at runtime.
A shared `ContentPolicyManager` now manages NSFW filtering across apps.
The new `NSFWManager` tags sensitive voice clips and enables stealth exports when unlocked.
The `NSFWHabitBehaviorSimulator` lets characters respond with custom audio cues when certain keywords are spoken.
For offline development you can set `USE_LOCAL_AI=1` in the environment to enable `LocalAIEnginePro`, a lightweight local model stub that replaces OpenAI calls.
When this flag is active, both audio and video generation rely entirely on the
local engines (`LocalVoiceAI` and the video routines in `CreatorCoreForge`), so
clips and narration can be produced without any network connection.

## App Store Compliance

For iOS builds, features that provide explicit NSFW content or haptic device integration are disabled. Age gating and parental controls remain enabled so the apps meet Apple's App Store Review Guidelines.
Data usage complies with privacy requirements, and only finalized, non-spammy features are shipped.
See [docs/AppStore_Compliance.md](docs/AppStore_Compliance.md) for more information.
See [docs/AppStore_Upload_Scheme.md](docs/AppStore_Upload_Scheme.md) for per-app upload details.

## Global Missing Items

The following components are planned across all apps but are still works in progress:

- [x] Shared `AutoUpdater.swift` module
- [x] Programmatically generated `.pbxproj` project files
- [x] App Store assets (`AppIcon.appiconset`, LaunchScreens)
- [ ] Final production UI polish
- [x] `.dmg` and `.exe` installers following `.ipa` builds

Run `./scripts/generate_pbxproj.sh` to generate missing Xcode project files for
any Swift packages under `apps/`.
All apps include an `AppStoreAssets` directory containing the icons and launch
screen files used for store submission.

## Desktop Build Script

Cross-platform builds can be generated using `electron-builder`. Run
`./scripts/build_desktop.sh` on macOS or Windows to produce `.dmg` and
`.exe` installers for apps that include a `Desktop` project. macOS and Linux
hosts must have `wine` and `mono` installed to generate the Windows builds.
See
`docs/CrossPlatformBuild.md` for details. For a full multi-platform build (iOS,
Android, Web, Chrome, and Edge) execute `./scripts/universal_build.sh` which
calls the appropriate tools when present.

Each app includes a `Desktop` folder with a starter Electron configuration for
building installers.

## Ebook2Audiobook Integration
A snapshot of the open source `ebook2audiobook` project is included under `apps/ebook2audiobook`. Use the helper script `scripts/ebook2audiobook_bridge.py` to convert eBooks to narrated audio from any CoreForge app:

```bash
./scripts/ebook2audiobook_bridge.py MyBook.epub -o output_audio
```

This invokes the Python pipeline to generate WAV files in the given directory.
## AI Video Generator Integration
A trimmed snapshot of the open source `ai-video-generator` project is included under `apps/AI_VideoGenerator`. Run `python server.py` in that folder to start the FastAPI backend for generating text-to-video clips.


## Chatterbox Script Conversion
Use `scripts/chatterbox_bridge.py` to generate a narrated play from a simple `SPEAKER: line` script. Place `speaker.mp3` samples next to your script and set `CHATTERBOX_API_URL` before running:
```bash
./scripts/chatterbox_bridge.py script.txt
```

Run `scripts/progress_bot.py` to view app progress and generate snippet files for missing features.
Run `scripts/generate_app_completion_report.py` to update `app_completion_report.json` and `docs/App_Completion_Summary.md`.
See `docs/progress_bot.md` for usage details.
## Running Tests

Install Node dependencies for the labs before running the test suites:

```bash
cd VoiceLab && npm install && npm test
cd ../VisualLab && npm install && npm test
cd .. && swift test
```

This ensures `jest`, `ts-node`, and other dev tools are available.


## CI/CD
The repository uses GitHub Actions workflows for building, testing, and releasing the apps across platforms. See the files in [.github/workflows](./.github/workflows) for details.





## Fetching n8n Workflow Engine

Use `./scripts/fetch_n8n.sh` to clone or update the [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) automation engine under `external/n8n`. Review the license printed at the end of the script before integrating it into your projects.


After fetching the repository, you can leverage VoiceLab's `runN8nAssistant` helper to experiment with n8n-inspired AI workflows locally.
