✅ CODEX-TODO-ENHANCE-ALL-OPEN-TASKS.md

## Purpose:
Codex should identify and enhance all currently open tasks across the CoreForge Build platform, ensuring each related file is:

- Fully coded with complete logic
- App Store compliant
- Performance-optimized
- Tested and integrated across all supported platforms

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Task Inventory Scan

- [x] Scan all `FEATURES-CODEX-COMPLETE.md` and `CODEX-TODO-*` files for:
  - Open `[ ]` task checkboxes
  - Descriptions of modules or features not yet implemented
- [x] Match each open task with expected source file(s) and language
- [x] Output a task-to-file map in `open_tasks_registry.json`

---

## 🛠 Step 2: File Creation & Enhancement

For each open task, Codex should:

### 🔧 Standard Task Format

- [x] **Task:** Implement or complete logic for `[OPEN TASK DESCRIPTION]`
  **Related File:** `[TARGET_FILENAME]`  
  **Category:** `[UI / Logic / Parser / Export / Marketplace / Plugin / Security]`  
  **Goal:** Complete this module for full production readiness  
  **Requirements:**
    - Must contain actual logic, state management, API calls, or component rendering
    - Follow modular structure with typed inputs and testable outputs
    - Include comments and comply with CoreForge feature standards
  **Output:** Fully functional, tested file ready for deployment

---

## ✅ Sample Enhancements

- [x] Build `formGenerator.tsx`
  - Task: “Auto-generate logic for forms from user prompt”
  - Category: Form Builder
  - File must accept schema input, render dynamic form, handle validation

- [x] Complete `LivePreviewPane.vue`
  - Task: “Enable real-time preview for mobile and web app layouts”
  - Category: Debug Preview
  - Must display responsive view, trigger re-render on layout changes

- [x] Finish `PluginManager.ts`
  - Task: “Load and validate marketplace plugins”
  - Category: Plugin Loader
  - Scan metadata, allow toggle, sandbox test before injection

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Validation

 - [x] Run unit and integration tests for all created or updated files
 - [x] Confirm output accuracy with test case assertions
 - [x] Add updated files to GitHub commits with changelog
 - [x] Track files in `enhanced_file_registry.json`

---

## 📦 Step 4: Final Review

 - [x] Ensure every open Codex task has a completed file
 - [x] Confirm all generated files meet App Store & platform export requirements
 - [x] Mark tasks complete in all related markdowns and registry logs
