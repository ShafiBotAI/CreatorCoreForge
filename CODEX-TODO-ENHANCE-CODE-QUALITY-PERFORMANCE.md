✅ CODEX-TODO-ENHANCE-CODE-QUALITY-PERFORMANCE.md

## Purpose:
Enhance the implementation of all existing modules across CoreForge apps to achieve optimal performance, responsiveness, and maintainability. This applies to UI, backend logic, rendering engines, and system interfaces.

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Identify Optimization Opportunities

- [ ] Scan each file for:
  - Redundant logic or nested loops that can be simplified
  - Blocking synchronous calls in async contexts
  - Inefficient data structures or memory handling
  - Non-reusable or repeated code blocks
- [ ] Evaluate all components for:
  - CPU-bound render loops
  - I/O or network bottlenecks
  - Excessive re-renders in UI frameworks
- [ ] Log findings to `performance_scan_report.json` with:
  - File name, line number, optimization type
  - Suggested refactor direction

## 🛠 Step 2: Optimize Code Per Module

Codex should implement advanced improvements to all valid files, enhancing speed, readability, and modular structure.

### 🔧 Optimization Task Format

- [ ] **Task:** Enhance `[FILENAME]`  
  **Type:** `[Component / Parser / Service / Controller / Hook / Utility]`  
  **Goal:** Optimize for performance, reduce complexity, and modernize logic.  
  **Requirements:**
    - Use memoization or caching where applicable
    - Replace nested iteration with map/reduce/filter or async streaming
    - Refactor to separate logic from view/UI
    - Implement clean, typed function contracts
  **Output:** `[FILENAME]` with improved code structure, maintainability, and speed

## ✅ Sample Enhancements

- [ ] Optimize `SegmentService.swift`
  - Type: Parser
  - Goal: Improve segmentation performance on large texts
  - Requirements:
    - Refactor to async chunked processing
    - Implement semantic caching
    - Enable test coverage >90%

- [ ] Enhance `TTSRenderer.ts`
  - Type: Service
  - Goal: Improve audio rendering speed and stability
  - Requirements:
    - Use queue buffering for concurrent segment processing
    - Reduce retry delay via exponential backoff
    - Add monitoring callbacks for latency spikes

- [ ] Refactor `ChapterEditor.vue`
  - Type: UI Component
  - Goal: Reduce render load and memory footprint
  - Requirements:
    - Use virtual scrolling for large chapter lists
    - Extract subcomponents
    - Debounce user input events

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Validation

- [ ] Run performance tests before/after each refactor
- [ ] Measure memory footprint and latency where applicable
- [ ] Confirm visual/functional behavior remains consistent
- [ ] Document improvements in module-level CHANGELOG
