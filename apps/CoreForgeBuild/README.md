### BuildImprovementEngine
New in this release, `BuildImprovementEngine` scans existing projects for
missing implementations and potential vulnerabilities. It can automatically
replace common "Not implemented" placeholders, recommend refactors through
`AICoPilot`, and verify basic compliance documents are present.

### SelfRepairEngine
`SelfRepairEngine` leverages `BuildImprovementEngine` to scan every app in the
repository and automatically replace simple `fatalError("Not implemented")`
markers. It provides a summary of issues found and can be triggered as part of
the build workflow to keep all generated apps compiling.
