# CoreForge Audio Views

This directory contains SwiftUI views used throughout the CoreForge Audio
application. Each file defines a standalone UI component such as the library
dashboard, player controls, onboarding screens, and settings panels.

Views are organized by feature area to keep the project maintainable. Previews
are provided where possible so components can be inspected without launching the
full app.
