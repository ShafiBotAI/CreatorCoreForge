# âœ… CODEX-TODO-ENHANCE-CODE-QUALITY-NEXTGEN-OUTCOME.md

## Purpose:
Codex should revisit every implemented or in-progress feature, logic block, and source file across all CoreForge apps to upgrade their quality, flexibility, and performance to next-generation standards.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Scope:
- Improve clarity, readability, and scalability of all modules
- Extend the functional impact of each feature
- Reduce technical debt, duplicate logic, and rigid structures
- Upgrade design patterns to modern, declarative, modular approaches
- Ensure all apps feel future-ready, AI-augmented, and ultra-responsive

---

## ðŸ›  Step 1: Review + Refactor Targets

- [x] Identify all key logic layers: input parsing, code generation, plugin loading, rendering, export, testing
- [x] Detect overly nested, imperative, or brittle patterns
- [x] Flag low-cohesion files for abstraction and separation of concerns
- [x] Audit function names, variable naming, and interface documentation
- [x] Output review log to `upgrade_scan_report.json`

---

## ðŸ”§ Step 2: Next-Gen Enhancements Per Module

### âœ… Standard Upgrade Task Template

- [x] **Task:** Refactor `[MODULE_NAME]`  
  **File:** `[FILENAME]`  
  **Category:** `[UI / Engine / Logic / Plugin / Export / Builder]`  
  **Goal:** Evolve from functional to next-generation architecture  
  **Next-Gen Requirements:**
    - Declarative logic or UI (hook/state-based where applicable)
    - Modular structure with test isolation
    - Expand functionality: handle more states, more inputs, or new outputs
    - Use modern standards: ES modules, SwiftUI, composables, async generators
  **Output:** Fully modernized file with extended capabilities

---

## âœ… Sample Enhancements

- [x] Refactor `CodePreviewPanel.tsx`
  - Use debounced live update
  - Enable diff comparison mode and style themes
  - Support multi-language toggle (JS/Swift/Python)

- [x] Enhance `formLogicBuilder.ts`
  - Add conditional logic chains with visual schema output
  - Support dynamic field injection at runtime
  - Upgrade to schema-first validation model

- [x] Modernize `PluginExecutor.swift`
  - Refactor to async actor model
  - Add plugin-scoped memory cache
  - Support chained plugin execution graphs

---

## ðŸ§ª Step 3: Upgrade Validation

- [x] Unit test upgraded modules against all edge cases
- [x] Visual inspect any UI component modifications
- [x] Compare output structure/UX before vs after upgrade
- [x] Benchmark improved functions for performance gain
- [x] Push to GitHub with upgrade changelogs per module

---

## ðŸ“¦ Step 4: Final Results

- [x] Confirm all upgraded files pass compatibility and export tests
- [x] Replace old versions in production bundles
- [x] Summarize completed upgrades in `upgrade_report.md`
