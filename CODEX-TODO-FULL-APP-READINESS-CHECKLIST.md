### Step 3: Functional & Unit Testing Coverage
- [ ] Add test suites for new and existing modules.
- [ ] Ensure `scripts/run_all_tests.sh` passes without errors.

### Step 4: Deployment Readiness for All Formats

- [ ] Verify all assets and configuration files are in place for production.

### Final Checklist
- [ ] All folders and files exist with completed logic.
- [ ] All tests pass and coverage reports are up to date.
