# Practical Approach and Initial TODO List

This document outlines a phased plan for implementing the key features across the CreatorCoreForge ecosystem. It consolidates the large task lists into a focused starting point so contributors can prioritize work.

## 1. Foundation

1. **Shared Modules** – ensure `FusionEngine`, `LocalAIEngine`, and `LocalVoiceAI` are integrated across apps. Update `Package.swift` targets and maintain cross-app modules in `Sources`.
2. **CI Setup** – verify all workflows in `.github` run on pull requests. Update scripts in `fastlane` and `scripts` directories to support automated builds and tests.
3. **Testing** – run `swift test` and `npm test` (for `VisualLab` and `VoiceLab`) regularly. Expand coverage in `Tests` as new modules land.

## 2. CoreForge Audio

1. **Book Importer** – implement EPUB/PDF/TXT parsing to produce an array of `Chapter` objects with metadata.
2. **Chapter Detection** – add logic and GPT prompts to locate chapter boundaries in raw text.
3. **Segment Service** – split chapters into narration-ready segments with semantic boundaries.
4. **Voice Manager** – map segments to voice models and persist character mappings.
5. **TTS Service** – interface with ElevenLabs or LocalVoiceAI to render audio, including retry logic. Use `ElevenLabsClient.Options` to tune stability, similarity, and model ID for higher quality online output.
6. **Ambient Mixer** – layer ambience and SFX with volume envelopes and 3D positioning.
7. **NSFW Service** – detect explicit text, gate content, and enforce parental PIN checks.
8. **Playback Engine** – implement basic `play`, `pause`, and `seek` controls with a simple React UI.

## 3. CoreForge Visual

1. **Storyboard Importer** – parse input files into structured scenes.
2. **Scene Segmenter** – break scenes into shots using GPT guidance.
3. **Style Engine** – apply rendering presets (anime, live-action, fantasy).
4. **Frame Renderer** – assemble frames into clips with transitions and audio sync.

## 4. CoreForge Writer

1. **Outline Generator** – produce outlines with acts and scenes via GPT.
2. **World Memory Service** – persist lore, characters, and settings for reuse.
3. **Branch Service** – allow “what-if” story branching.
4. **Export Service** – support ePub and Docx generation with proper metadata.

## 5. CoreForge Studio

1. **MultiTrack Editor** – add track operations and threaded mixdown.
2. **Live Ensemble Room** – sync streams and chat between participants.
3. **Macro Workflow Engine** – record UI actions and replay as scripts.
4. **Export Production** – output MP4/MOV/WAV/MP3 with optional watermarks.

## 6. CoreForge Market

1. **Quantum Trading Engine** – build the hybrid trading module for multi-market analysis.
2. **Team Trading** – implement shared strategies and leaderboards.
3. **Bot Marketplace** – allow upload and monetization of trading bots.

## 7. CoreForge Build

1. **Figma Importer** – convert designs into layout templates.
2. **Universal Bundler** – automate iOS, Android, and desktop builds.
3. **Debug Assistant** – provide interactive troubleshooting for generated code.

## 8. CoreForge DNA

1. **DNA Tree UI** – visualize character and voice relationships.
2. **Cross-App Sync** – export/import DNA profiles across projects.
3. **Multiverse Merge** – compare and combine alternate timelines.

## 9. CoreForge Music

1. **Vocal Production** – integrate voice cloning with beat creation.
2. **Commercial Export** – add licensing and label-ready exports.
3. **Hook Marketplace** – enable sharing and selling of song templates.

## 10. CoreForge Leads

1. **Credit Ledger** – track and bill lead purchases.
2. **Global Exchange** – build API for cross-user lead trading.
3. **Scoring Engine** – refine AI ranking with real-time signals.

## 11. CoreForge Mind

1. **Mood Journal** – schedule daily entries with sentiment tracking.
2. **Guided Sessions** – deliver meditation and therapy audio.
3. **Private Vault** – secure personal data with optional NSFW modules.

## 12. CoreForge Bloom

1. **Cycle Tracking** – predict and visualize health insights.
2. **Wellness Reminders** – provide AI tips and sexual health notes.
3. **Wearable Sync** – integrate data from smart devices.

## 13. CoreForge Learn

1. **Curriculum Builder** – create lessons and quizzes via GPT.
2. **AI Tutor** – analyze progress and adapt challenges.
3. **Offline Sync** – maintain course data across devices.

## 14. CoreForge Quest

1. **Challenge Generator** – produce procedural quests.
2. **Leaderboard Events** – manage multiplayer rewards and rankings.
3. **Marketplace Items** – trade avatars and gear.

## 15. CoreForge Voice Lab

1. **Recording Tools** – capture and trim training audio.
2. **Training Pipeline** – automate dataset prep and voice cloning.
3. **Export Hooks** – send voices to Audio and Music apps.

## Next Steps

- Tackle one feature at a time, starting with the Audio importer and chapter detection.
- Keep `docs/PHASE_EIGHT.md` in sync with `features-phase8.json` as features progress.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` when major milestones are reached.

This checklist provides a practical starting point while leaving room for the advanced Phase 8 capabilities.
