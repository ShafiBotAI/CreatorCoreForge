# auto_code_bot.py

`auto_code_bot.py` scans the repository for incomplete features listed in `AGENTS.md` files. For each missing task it creates a small placeholder file under the `generated/` directory. When the `openai` package is installed and `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, the bot will attempt to generate a code snippet for the feature using the OpenAI API. If OpenAI is unavailable, the bot now falls back to a simple offline stub so the repo can be populated without an internet connection.

## Usage

```bash
python scripts/auto_code_bot.py
```

The script outputs generated files in subdirectories of `generated/`, one per app. These files are safe to edit or replace with full implementations.
