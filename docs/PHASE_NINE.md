# Phase Nine Tasks

This document outlines the major feature goals for Phase 9 of the CreatorCoreForge ecosystem. Items are sourced from `AGENTS.md` and the detailed checklist in `apps/CoreForgeAudio/AGENTS.md`.

The focus of this phase is **Full-Cast Audio Mastering & Creator Intelligence**. All items remain open until the implementation is complete.

## CoreForgeAudio Goals

- [x] Assign separate audio tracks to each character and narrator for post-mix mastering
- [x] Generate multitrack session files for DAWs (e.g., Logic, Pro Tools, Audition)
- [x] Sync ambient layers, voice tracks, and FX on a shared scene timeline
- [x] Enable per-character equalization, pitch adjustment, and compression
- [x] Simulate stereo spatial positioning per voice (left/right, near/far)
- [x] Build emotion intensity heatmap per scene to guide tone balancing
- [x] Create a full-cast preview mode with toggles for each voice track
- [x] Add creator-defined vocal layering for crowd and background dialogue
- [x] Offer toggle for "narrator override" mode for consistency across multi-voice scenes
- [x] Auto-suggest optimal scene pacing based on text intensity and emotion tags
- [x] Detect dialogue overlap potential and adjust timing automatically
- [x] Use AI to recommend narration cadence per genre and reader preference
- [x] Export final audio as flattened or layered file based on creator choice
- [x] Tag character emotional states per segment to match musical score inputs
- [x] Link scene-based voice dynamics to background music templates
- [x] Integrate with audio plugin systems for advanced mastering tools
- [x] Enable Creator AI Assistant to generate scene-specific mastering presets
- [x] Provide auto-mix-and-export mode for rapid prototyping
- [x] Build creator dashboard for real-time monitoring of voice quality and performance
- [x] Visualize voice dominance per chapter using waveform or tone charts
- [x] Offer beta features: audio fingerprints for licensing, alternate casting previews
- [x] AI-based performance coach to recommend enhancements after preview

Use this checklist to track progress as Phase 9 capabilities are developed.
