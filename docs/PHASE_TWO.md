# Phase Two Roadmap

Phase two focuses on expanding monetization features across the apps and polishing the user experience.

## Highlights
- **CoreForge Leads** introduces a new `MarketplaceCreditSystem` to allow paid lead purchases.
- Other apps will integrate similar credit models and enhanced auto-update support.

Run `swift test` before submitting changes to ensure the shared libraries remain stable.
