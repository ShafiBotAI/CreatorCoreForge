# App Store Compliance Notes

CreatorCoreForge includes optional NSFW and advanced features across its apps. To comply with Apple App Store policies, the following restrictions apply when building for iOS:

- NSFW modes and erotic content are disabled on iOS builds. Features that provide adult or explicit material are limited to platforms that permit such content.
- Haptic or teledildonic device integrations are excluded from iOS binaries.
- App Store versions must use age gating and parental controls for any mature themed content.
- Data collection follows Apple's privacy requirements (Guideline 5.1) with clear consent prompts.
- Apps avoid spammy functionality or placeholder content (Guideline 4.3) and include only finalized, user-facing features.

These limitations ensure the iOS releases adhere to the App Store Review Guidelines.
