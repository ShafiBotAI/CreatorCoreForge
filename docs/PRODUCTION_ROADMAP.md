# Production Approach for CreatorCoreForge Apps

This roadmap outlines the high level steps required to bring each application in the CreatorCoreForge ecosystem to a production ready state. Use it alongside `docs/PRACTICAL_PLAN.md`, the individual `AGENTS.md` files, and `features-phase8.json`.

---

## Shared Requirements

1. **Finalize Shared Engines** – ensure `FusionEngine`, `LocalAIEnginePro`, and `LocalVoiceAI` are integrated across all apps with consistent APIs.
2. **Cross-Platform Builds** – verify that iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Web targets can be generated using the provided scripts and Fastlane lanes.
3. **Automated Testing** – expand unit and integration tests in `Tests/` and run `npm test` for the labs. Continuous integration should remain green before publishing releases.
4. **Security & Compliance** – audit data handling, NSFW gating, and privacy flows to satisfy GDPR, CCPA, and app store policies.
5. **Installers & Store Assets** – produce `.ipa`, `.apk`, `.dmg`, and `.exe` packages. Collect icons, screenshots, and metadata for each store listing.
6. **Documentation** – keep `docs/PHASE_EIGHT.md` and per-app READMEs up to date with new features.
